Ruby on Rails ecosystem grows to be solid and mature in this year. Also, this framework's tagline: "from HELLO WORLD to IPO" and the direction from the DHH (CTO of 37Signals) makes me attempt to try this framework. I come from the PHP programming and has been programming for 7 years professionally. I'm not familiar with Ruby programming especially their syntax. But, it doesn't prevent me to learn it. So, I seek a shortcut to taste Ruby programming and I find [TryRuby site](https://try.ruby-lang.org) is a good start. After that, I go to [Ruby on Rails's site](https://rubyonrails.org) to taste this framework by follow their guide/tutorial like make a blog or e-commerce. Hmm, I think I can follow their guide and make more shape in frameworks like Laravel, SvelteKit, and so on.
