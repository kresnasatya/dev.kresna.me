This post is about when did I know React and Svelte, vibes between React and Svelte, and why I prefer Svelte over React.

## Birth of React

When React released, why it was released, when I know it?

## Birth of Svelte

When Svelte released, why it was released, when I know it?

## Vibes

Here's the [definition of Vibes according to Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vibe).

> *"A distinctive feeling or quality capable of being sensed"*

E.g.

This place has a good/bad vibe.
She gave me a weird vibe. = She gave off a weird vibe. = I got a weird vibe from her.

The vibes I mean is how I feel when I do web programming using React and Svelte.

- State
- Derived
- Effect
- Hooks for React
- Signal for Svelte
