When I work on project as a person or a team, I have an idealism to make sure that the project still works even I leave it. To make it happened, documentation is a key.

> README is a key.

Take an initial steps like short description of this project then how to run in our lovely local machine. That's it! Everyone has a chance but not everyone willing to do it because of silo or maybe they see that they still have a time. I'm also sometimes in this position too. But, I remind about Steve Jobs qoute. It looks like this.

Anyway, documentation is hard but it's really worth it for long term.
