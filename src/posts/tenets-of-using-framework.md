This post inspired from [Rich Harris's Tenets on GitHub sveltejs/svelte discussion](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/discussions/10085).

1. Follow the framework rules

Follow the framework rules until you're ready to break the framework rules.

2. Be picky when you choose third-party libraries or dependencies

Who knows they will be not maintain anymore. My personal tips is choose third-party libraries that maintain by company that work close with the framework. Example Spatie and Tighten are companies that work closely with the Laravel framework. Also, read [37Signals post: A vanilla Rails stack is plenty](https://dev.37signals.com/a-vanilla-rails-stack-is-plenty/).

3. Follow Rich Harris's Quote
