We as a programmer (either professional or hobby) have a personal setup in our computer. When we get a fresh installed computer, we setup everything in order to make our computer fit with us. The setup can be install software, tools, or make a configuration. I also do that. But, unfortunately the setup is undocumented a.k.a inside my brain. Human tends to forget. So, in order to prevent that happen, they make a note as a secondary brain. DHH makes a clear setup for his work when use Ubuntu, it called [Omakase Ubuntu (OMAKUB)](https://omakub.org). I also see another [programmers](https://github.com/craftzdog/dotfiles-public) [create a](https://github.com/driesvints/dotfiles) [dotfiles](https://github.com/mattstauffer/dotfiles) repository on GitHub as their personal setup when they get a fresh installed computer. Inherit the same spirit, I create a [setup note in my GitHub profile](https://github.com/kresnasatya/setup). It helps me in case I forget the awesome software or awesome configuration that I have setup in my computer.
