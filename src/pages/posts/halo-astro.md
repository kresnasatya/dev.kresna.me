Astro. Astro Boy? Astro (Korean Boyband)? No! The Astro that I mean is a web framework. At the first time I know Astro in my Twitter Timeline, I was thinking that Astro is a Static Site Generator (SSG) same as Hugo, a fast SSG build with Go programming language. Although the engine of Astro build with Go programming language, but I think Astro offers some features that I could not resist to try it! I think it’s also an opportunity to try another tool beside Hugo. Btw, my personal site is using Hugo.

I choose Astro because of three reasons. First, I would like to taste another tool to create a site. My personal site created with Hugo. Second, I interest with Islands Architecture concept from Astro. Although, the Islands Architecture was a name of idea from Jason Miller (Preact’s creator) and the Island Architecture originally was a “Component Islands” that was created by Katie Sylor. Honestly, I’m pretty sure that around 2019 and 2020, I see a video presentation from Katie Sylor-Miller on YouTube or Vimeo that talks about “Component Islands” but I don’t see it anywhere now. I’m not sure if I’m hallucinate or not, but I’m pretty sure that I’m not hallucinate about it. Third, UI-Agnostic from Astro. I love Svelte because syntax brevity and Rich Harris’s marketing and and his philosophy build better web development with less headache concepts (I talk about you, ReactJS) but I don’t use it seriously in any projects. I think I can mix Svelte and Astro together here! Let's see!

This site is on progress. I have several ideas about this site like dual language (English and Bahasa Indonesia), search feature (steal the concept from Jacky Efendi’s site), dark mode feature, and mini-playgrounds. I set English language as default because I would like interact with world-wide programmer, software developer, or anybody who have same interest topics with me in this blog.
